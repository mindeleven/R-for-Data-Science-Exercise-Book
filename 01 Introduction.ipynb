    "Data that's stored externally gets loaded into a data frame in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Tidying your data (Wrangling part 1)\n",
    "When data is tidy each column is a variable and each row is an observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Transformation of data (Wrangling part 2)\n",
    "You choose your areas or observations of interest and then you narrow in on these observations by creating new variables out of existing ones or calculating summary statistics.\n",

    "Visualisations will help you to explore the data by showing unexpected relations that may lead to new hypotheses.\n",

    "Models are complementary to visualisations and can be used to answer your formulated questions. A model is based on assumptions that the model itself cannot question."
